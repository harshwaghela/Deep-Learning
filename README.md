# Deep Learning

### This repository contains Python notebooks for my implemented Deep Learning projects and assignments.

#Contents:
## CNN-CIFAR10
    * Designed a 7-layer Convolutional Neural Network using Python - TensorFlow framework achieving a test accuracy of ~ 75%.
    * Leveraged Z-score normalization, Data Augmentation, Batch Normalization and Dropout techniques to achieve higher accuracy.

## Face-Emo-recognition
   * Designed a model that uses shared layers to identify and learn common features of the human face for Face Recognition and Expression Detection.
   * Uses multiple loss functions.
   * Model outputs a probability over five expressions in addition to the subjects identity.

## Neural Networks and Deep Learning - Coursera
* Implementation from Deeplearning.ai course taken on Coursera
