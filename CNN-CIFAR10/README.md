## The objectives of this exercise
* Implement the forward and backward passes as well as the neural network training procedure
* Implement the widely-used optimizers and training tricks including dropout
* Get familiar with TensorFlow by training and designing a network on your own
* Learn how to fine-tune trained networks
* Visualize the learned weights and activation maps of a ConvNet
* Use Grad-CAM to visualize and reason why ConvNet makes certain predictions


### Problem 1: Basics of Neural Networks
The IPython Notebook `Problem_1.ipynb` will walk you through implementing the basics of neural networks.

### Problem 2: Getting familiar with TensorFlow
The IPython Notebook `Problem_2.ipynb` will help you with a better understanding of implementing a simple ConvNet in Tensorflow.

### Problem 3: Training and Fine-tuning on MNIST
The IPython Notebook `Problem_3.ipynb` will walk you through training a neural network from scratch on a dataset and fine-tuning on another one for transfer learning.

### Problem 4: Visualizations and CAM
The IPython Notebook `Problem_4.ipynb` will gain you insights with what neural networks learn with the skills of visualizing them.
