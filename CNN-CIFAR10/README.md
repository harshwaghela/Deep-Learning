## Problems
In each of the notebook file, we indicate `TODO` or `Your Code` for you to fill in with your implementation.
Majority of implementations will also be required under `lib` with specified tags.

### Problem 1: Basics of Neural Networks 
The IPython Notebook `Problem_1.ipynb` will walk you through implementing the basics of neural networks.

### Problem 2: Getting familiar with TensorFlow 
The IPython Notebook `Problem_2.ipynb` will help you with a better understanding of implementing a simple ConvNet in Tensorflow.

### Problem 3: Training and Fine-tuning on MNIST 
The IPython Notebook `Problem_3.ipynb` will walk you through training a neural network from scratch on a dataset and fine-tuning on another one for transfer learning.

### Problem 4: Visualizations and CAM
The IPython Notebook `Problem_4.ipynb` will gain you insights with what neural networks learn with the skills of visualizing them.
